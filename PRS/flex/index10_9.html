A singleton is a pat with only 1 digit in it. No pinch flex (P) is possible if there
 is a singleton in pat 1, 3, or 5. No V-flex (V) is possible if there is a singleton
 in 1, 4, or 5. Use Rotate (R) or Rotate Right (r) to get the singletons in the desired locations.

After you click on Pinch or V-Flex, click on 'See' to view the current winding.

      <td><b>Nonahexaflexagon Construction</b><P>

	In order to build the nonahexaflexagon, you will need to start 
with a roll of paper
tape. Start by folding an equilateral triangle at the 
beginning of the tape and then reproducing it until you have 
twenty-seven triangles. </td>

<LI>rotate the 5 under the 4 to get 4,5            *The white triangles disappear*
<LI>fold the 4 under the 3 to get 32,54, and  *The dark green triangles disappear*
<LI>place the 3 under the 1 to get 1,4523 *The pink triangles disappear*
</OL>Notice that the one that is to the left of the comma is smaller than all of the digits to the right of it. This gives Figure 11.

      <td>Note that the blue 1 on the orange triangle is hidden 
by the blue 25 on the purple triangle. Finish up the folding 
by twisting 25 over 24, 27 under 26, and 26 under 25 (See Figure 16). 
The last step in the construction is applying one piece of tape to the 
common edge of 27 and triangle 1 that is touching it. This is a little 
cumbersome 
because 27 is hidden between triangles 25 and 26. 
The Tuckerman Traverse is shown below in Fig. 17 and you have just constructed the orange face that is more centered in the Tuckerman Traverse.</td>

For the nonahexaflexagon there are 61,108 faces that can be visited by the V-flex and a total of 100,699 when the pinch flex is added.`
