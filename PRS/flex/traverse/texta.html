<img src="traverse/traverse.JPG"></td><td>Using the applet on the previous 
page that always starts with face 0, flex according to the color and see if 
you agree with my modest beginning. How are we going to display all 100000 
faces where anyone can flex to any predetermined face?
I have a program that numbers the nodes differently. I would like to 
number the nodes in a more systematic way as shown here. Do you have any ideas?
