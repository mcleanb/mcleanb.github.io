Abstract </H2> <BR><FONT SIZE  = 4>This  is a DOS graphics screen simulation, 
used to teach statistics to industrial practitioners, high school students, and 
undergraduates.  White pulp is added to blue water that flows through 
various size pipes.  Five different multi-colored chemicals are added to the 
process to change the strength and tearing properties of the paper. The 
student can design an experiment to maximize the first while minimizing 
the second dependent variable.  Samples can be collected from nine different 
locations in the process and displayed on the screen or written to a file.  At 
the user's request, the system can be upset to simulate the clogging or 
deterioration of one of the seven gaskets.   Data for x-bar and R control 
charts can be collected at three different locations to assist in the 
determination of  a problem caused by upsetting the system.   Pre-
measurements along the way in the process can be used to teach 
correlation.  The instructor can control the mean and the standard 
deviation of each substance in the process.<p></FONT SIZE  = 4>

<h2>Introduction</h2><BR><FONT SIZE  = 4> The program, called flo, was written  
after a conversation with Robert A. McLean. of the University of Tennessee.  
He stated that it would be nice to have a computer simulation where 
students from industry could gather data for a designed experiment or for  
developing control charts.  They could learn the lessons of producing a 
quality product without interrupting production.  Once the techniques were 
mastered, then they could move their data analysis skills to the floor where 
they are needed.  Having just toured a local paper factory, this program was 
developed and is being used in   service courses at the undergraduate level 
as well as classes in experimental design.<p> </font size = 4>

<H2>Changing concentrations</H2>  <FONT SIZE  = 4>The program begins with light blue water 
flowing through dark blue pipes entering from the upper left corner of the 
DOS graphics screen.  Pulp is entered at the first corner by selecting the 
pipe color 1 or 5.   The selection collar is positioned  by touching the 
digit one.  The percentage of white desired can then be entered.  To enter a 
setting of ten percent,  simply touch E followed by the digits one and zero.  
The user can then select  a subset of the remaining colors and add the 
desired percentages of those colors.  Decide on the digit of the pipe color to 
change, touch that digit, and then touch E followed by two digits.  Additional 
water can be added at two of the locations, eight and nine.  Increasing the 
amount of pure water at pipe color eight reduces the percentage of pulp 
emitting from pipe color five and the percentage of the pink chemical from 
six.  Similarly, increasing the water at nine decreases the percentages from 
one and two.  The six colors from the seven locations together with the 
additional water blend into a mixture in the lower right corner.  Here the 
solution is dried on large rollers and paper is manufactured.  Only  the 
water,  pulp, and chemicals are displayed in this simulation. <p>

Sampling independent variables</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4>  To sample the mixture, select one of  the 
nine locations by holding the shift key down and then touching a digit.   The numbering for sampling is the  same as for changing the mean of the concentrations except eight and nine 
have been moved to more convenient sampling  locations.  By touching the 
letter S, a ten by ten sample is displayed in the center of the screen and the 
100 pixels are counted for the user.  Then touching the letter H, will display 
a histogram of all of the  pixels in the entire pipe in the upper left corner.  H 
and S are toggles, so touching H H or S S again will produce different 
results based upon the mean and standard deviation of each pipe color.<p>
</FONT SIZE  = 4><H2>
Sampling dependent variables</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4>  When requested, two dependent variables 
are displayed at sampling pipe locations four, eight, and nine.  Just touch 
the letter  V.  One might try to maximize the top number and minimize the 
bottom one.  The letter V is a toggle and will erase and then display  the 
variables using the new sample.  The user can program  a cubic equation or 
an exponential for these two dependent variables.  The predicted values at 
sampling locations eight and nine can be used to study correlations with 
the dependent variables at pipe four.<p>

</FONT SIZE  = 4><H2>Control charts</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4>  Data for control charts can be collected at sampling 
locations eight, nine, or four.  Simply touch the letter C and you will be asked 
to give the location, the number of samples each time, the time between 
samples, and the total number of times to sample.    You will be kept informed on the screen which charting  sample is being collected.  The program will notify you when all of the 
charting data has been collected.  The data is written to the ASCII file 
CHARTn.DAT.  This file can then be imported into most statistical 
programs to produce the requested charts.  Pixel counts at locations one 
through nine can be collected by touching P and informing the program 
where, when, and how many samples of one hundred pixels you want 
collected.  The results are written to the ASCII  file PIXELn.DAT.  A file 
called ACTIONn.DAT is also created to record all of the important key 
strokes.  The data for this file is collected  until all of the samples have been 
saved.   Again you will be kept informed as to which sample is being 
collected and when the required number of samples is finished. <p>
</FONT SIZE  = 4><H2>Experimental  design.</H2> <FONT SIZE  = 4>A designed experiment  can be 
conducted by first touching D and answering the usual questions.  In order 
to  design an experiment with twenty-four cells, one will have to touch D 
twenty-four more times  to complete the experiment.  The program will 
keep the user informed on how many cells have been collected .  The values 
of the independent and dependent variables will end up in the ASCII file 
DESIGNn.DAT for analysis.   By optionally touching V, each of the 24 
readings of the dependent variables will also be displayed on the 
screen.<P></FONT SIZE  = 4>
<H2>Upsets</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4>  Upsets  to the system can be predetermined by the 
user in an ASCII file, SIGMAS.DAT.  A particular color gasket can be 
chosen to leak or clog, causing x-bar or R control charts to go out of control 
or interfering with a designed experiment.   The default is for orange, pipe 
color two, to cycle between two predetermined values over a specified period 
of  time.   The number of times the orange mean has changed, is displayed 
on the screen.  Upsets  to the system can be predetermined by the 
user in an ASCII file, SIGMAS.DAT.  To fix the system from the upset, touch F and answer the 
questions.   Each of the preceding topics are independent of each other and 
can all be run simultaneously.   Touching T, followed by a key stroke of 
your choice, begins the tutorial.  If the tutorial is left on while setting up a 
chart, pixel count, or designed experiment, there will be an example 
problem displayed to assist the user.  Terminate the tutorial by touching T  
again.  The pressure in the pipes can be regulated by  touching R for retard 
followed by a digit.  R 9 is very slow and R 0 is the default.  The clock does not 
change its speed when the system is retarded.  Independently the clock can 
be speeded up by not having to draw all of the graphics.  This permits a lot of 
data to be collected for a control chart, pixel collection, or a designed 
experiment in a very small amount of real time.  I 9 is as fast as the 
simulation can move and I 0 is the default.   ASCII files can be read or 
written without interrupting the simulation by touching O and W 
respectively.  A lot of  ninety-five percent confidence intervals  for mu can 
also be collected for teaching that subject.<p></FONT SIZE  = 4>

<H2>The program</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4>  This is a Turbo Pascal Ò V7.0 program that 
uses the  Pascal file EGAVGA. GBI file for displaying the ever changing 
pixel flow.  The random number generator provided by Borland Inc. is used 
in conjunction with the Box - Mueller  algorithm for turning two 
independent uniform distributions into a normal distribution.   The 
standard deviations of the independent variable  can be initialized by the 
SIGMAS.DAT file or changed later by using  F for fixing the system.  The 
default standard deviation is 1.5.  If the SIGMAS.DAT file is not available, 
the program will still run with an exponential equation for the top 
dependent and a quadratic for the lower variable.<p></FONT SIZE  = 4>

<H2>Appreciation</H2><FONT SIZE  = 4> Thanks go to Robert A. McLean for his 
reviews and all of his detailed suggestions for improvement in the writing 
of this program.</FONT SIZE  = 4>
