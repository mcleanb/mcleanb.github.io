<TR><TD><BR>The above applet was improved by colleague, Emil Iacob and Georgia Southern students.


It
has a [R] Rotate Clockwise, [r] Rotate Counterclockwise, [P] Pinch Flex, [V] V-flex and an [U] Upside Down
button to help back up. UPU undoes a P while URVUR undoes a V. I finished this version
during December 2009. Other contributors in addition to Emil were students John Nelson and Chasen
Smith. To proceed through the Tuckerman Traverse using only the pinch flex, continue to pinch until you
see singletons. They will be denoted by
a black mark on a white background. Rotate once before the next pinch and you will see the
singletons again. Rotate in the same direction and pinch again.
Once the singletons vanish, return to pinches without rotating. Summarizing,
P P R P R P P P R P R P P P R P R P P P should produce the Tuckerman Pinch
Traverse.<img src="hex.JPG">
 </td></tr>
<tr><td>In this section we will not be doing any Pinches, just V's. One interesting
pattern is the red cardioid on the McLean Traverse shown below in the first Figure 10 and executed in the applet
as RV and then RRV
repeated 14 more times. After the first RV, you will see where the pat of degree one is located by
a black mark on a white background. Rotate that singleton to the red mark to stay on the red cardioid.
To follow a purple path, rotate the singleton to the purple mark before the V-flex. Once you are on the
purple path you must line the 2 singletons up on the blue and the purple marks until you return to the red
cardioid. Similarly, leave the red cardioid on a blue path by moving the singleton to the blue mark and
stay on the blue path the same way you stayed on the purple path.</td></tr><TR><TD>The reason this paper is here is because Alan Moluf and Bob Verrey
found the following sequence in 1965 and I refused to give up until I could replicate it. RV and
then 5 RRV. Move to the purple triangle in the traverse
and back to the cardioid with RRRV
V and V . Then move down the cardioid with a rV. Finish the cardioid with 8 RRV's. What do
you see? A perfect hexahexaflexagon but the colors alternate in color. The back side colors are now  on the front.
<UL>If the singleton is in <li>Pat 4 you will stay on the red cardioid,</li>
<li>Pat 3 you will leave on the purple path clockwise,</li>
<li>Pat 1 you will leave on the blue path clockwise.</li>

</UL><LI>Placing 2 singletons in Pat 1 and Pat 3 keeps you traveling on the side paths until you return to the cardioid.

Three of the faces, 1, 4,and 6 occur 3 different times, making it possible for the
drawings on those faces to appear three completely different ways. If we turned the flexagon
upside down we would see the same three faces in the opposite direction
</a>.<HR>

In the spirit of the Oakley Wisner paper, we never turn the flexagon upside down in our paper.
If you would prefer, the number of faces on the back is the same but they do look differently,
so just double our results.
</TD></TR>

<tr><td>The "Combinatorics of all Regular Flexagons"  began at
Georgia Southern University in 2006.
The enormity of
the computer solution
for the nine face flexagon indicated that the 12 face flexagon
solution may exceed the computer's capacity. Thus we embarked upon a general solution to the Thomas
Anderson pat sequence (Homeira proves theorem 2, but

Thomas knew this sequence better than anyone else).
The next to the last applet in the table below is based upon theorem 2. Then we began an
algebraic approach to count the mathematical faces of order 3n for all n.
The paper is now finished and the new applet at the bottom of the first table counts the mathematical
faces for n = 1 through n = 4. What is missing is the traverse, similar to the McLean Traverse in the 1979 paper.</td></tr>

A singleton is a pat with only 1 digit in it. No pinch flex (P) is possible if there
 is a singleton in pat 1, 3, or 5. No V-flex (V) is possible if there is a singleton
 in 2, 5, or 6. Use Clockwise Rotation (R) or Counter Clockwise (r) to get the
 singletons in the desired locations.

<TR><TD>Copyright 2008 - Welcome to our applet from our recent publication at the bottom. It currently only accepts n in { 1, 2, 3, 4} but the code would work
for larger n if the integer  data type is improved. The total number of cases to be considered is C(n).

The number of initial faces (no translations) for a 3n-ahexaflexagon is F2(n) + F6(n) and the number of
mathematical faces is in the last box. As an example, enter 2 for n and we get =18*(192-3)+3*6 = 3420 mathematical faces. 3 are so symmetric that we can only multiply by 6 while the other initial faces can be multiplied by 18.

The last step in the construction is applying one piece of tape to the
common edge of 27 and triangle 1 that is touching it. This is a little
cumbersome
because 27 is hidden between triangles 25 and 26.
The Tuckerman Traverse, rediscovered by Emily McLean in 2002, is shown below in Fig. 17 and you have just constructed the orange face that is more centered in the Tuckerman Traverse.</td>
