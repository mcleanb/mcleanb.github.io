<tr><td>For the nonahexaflexagon there are 100,698 initial faces.
Translations put the total number of mathematical faces at 2,718,576. Justification for these results are available at

	In order to build the nonahexaflexagon, you will need to start
with a roll of paper
tape. Start by folding an equilateral triangle at the
beginning of the tape and then reproducing it until you have
twenty-seven triangles. </td>

</OL>Notice that the one that is to the left of the comma is smaller than all of the digits to the right of it. This gives Figure 11.

      <td>Note that the blue 1 on the orange triangle is hidden
by the blue 25 on the purple triangle. Finish up the folding
by twisting 25 over 24, 27 under 26, and 26 under 25 (See Figure 16).
The last step in the construction is applying one piece of tape to the
common edge of 27 and triangle 1 that is touching it. This is a little
cumbersome
because 27 is hidden between triangles 25 and 26.
The Tuckerman Traverse, rediscovered by Emily McLean in 2002, is shown below in Fig. 17 and you have just constructed the orange face that is more centered in the Tuckerman Traverse.</td>

<LI>2010, posted 7/22/2011 Hua Wang - The number of pats of degree 3n+1 is C(4n,n)/(3n+1) and of degree
3n+2 is 2*C(4n+1,n)/(3n+2). |C(n)| = C(3n+2,5)/3 + 2n/3. C(n) is explained on Page 2, while C(n,r) is the
combination of n things taken r at a time.</li>

<LI>6/26/2010 I do not have a
proof that all regular flexagons can be
translated by 1 and Ralph Jones pointed this out to me. I
ignored this fact in our
paper, "The combinatorics of
all regular flexagons." In 1979, I gave a constructive proof that it was true for the
hexahexaflexagon. With some help from Emily McLean and a java program, I found a similar
demonstrative proof
for
the nonahexaflexagon. Thus I can really say that the nonahexaflexagon has
2,718,576 mathematical faces.

The JPG on the left  shows one
main cardioid for the nona. The top and right side provides two different path to face 9 of the
cardioid.
Face 12 of the alternate path is a 13 translate of the first one.
Since 13 and 27 are relatively prime, we really can translate any nona face by any amount making the effort
worthwhile
in the 2010 paper.
