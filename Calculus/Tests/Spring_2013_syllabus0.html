<FONT size=+1><FONT size=4>The prerequisite for this class is the thorough
knowledge of algebra, and trigonometry. It will take an intense effort to keep
up. The text is the 12th edition of <I>Calculus</I> by Thomas. (Addison Wesley,
ISBN: 978-0-321-58799-2 Chapters 2 - 6 ) You can
purchase an on-line book with an access code, a used book with an access code,
or a new book with an access code. The prices are approximately $56, $121, and
$161 respectfully. Sign yourself up for mclean20329 at http://pearsonmylabandmastering.com/. You may also buy your on-line text
there as well. These are a one time fee and it makes the text book good for at
least the next three semesters at Georgia Southern. I also make heavy use of
GeorgiaView in my lectures and that is covered by your University technology fee
that is already paid. All communications from me will be made on GeorgiaView.
This includes test dates that will be on the calendar and homework assignments
under Weblinks.
<P>A graphing calculator is recommended for in-class work, homework, and taking
hourly tests but is not required. You may not use a TI-89 or higher nor your phone.</FONT></FONT>
<FONT size=+1><FONT size=4>You may use your calculator on all recitations, every test, and the final
examination. An excellent resource for all the TI calculators can be found
