<p>We are going to execute a program called TextPad that is
shareware.  This means that they will constantly ask you
to buy it until you do.  It is downloadable from
http://www.TextPad.com
<p>
TextPad makes writing a Java program a little bit easier.
Java is free from http://www.sun.com but is very large
- 20 megabytes.
<p>
We will write commands to the computer in an English
like language.  Some of the keywords are class, for, while,
if, then, else, import, and print. If we write these rules
correctly, then the computer will carry them out after they
are compiled.  A compiler is a  program that someone has
written that takes our keywords and turns them into machine
language.  The only language a cpu can understand is machine
language.  The Central Processing Unit is refered to as a CPU.
