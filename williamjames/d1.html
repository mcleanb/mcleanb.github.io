Hello! &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="cool.GIF"> <img src = "Snowman.GIF"> <p>My name is Bruce McLean and I have volunteered to teach some of the 6th graders at William James Middle School a programming language called <font color = "ff00ff">Java</font> and a web based language called <font color = "ff00ff">HTML</font>.  I am a mathematics professor at Georgia Southern University and my daughter, Emily, will be in the class.  I will be assisted by another professor, Don Brown, and a parent, Jack Tenzel, an ophthalmologist here in Statesboro.  I certainly have not had the time to talk to all of the parents, but if you  have an expertise in this area, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:mac@gsu.cs.gasou.edu"> mac@gsu.cs.gasou.edu</a> and you can help also.<P><img src="sesame.GIF">HTML stands for <font color = "ff00ff">Hyper Text Markup Language</font>.  It is a language that all present day <font color = "ff00ff">browsers</font> can read and then publish to a web page.  Some examples of browsers are <font color = "ff00ff">Netscape</font> and <font color = "ff00ff">Internet Explorer</font>.  The latter one is owned by Microsoft and the first by Sun microsystems.  Sun also developed the Java programming language and the java compiler can be downloaded from htttp://www.sun.com for free.  If you have any trouble obtaining this compiler or installing it on your own computer, drop me a line.  The only prerequisite for the course is a love of mathematics.  Without the knowlededge of mathematics, programming a computer is a waste of time.<p><img src="circle.GIF">  I envision placing graphics on the web with mathematical lessons being learned at the same time.  In a few weeks, we should be able to draw pictures,  calculate lengths, areas, and volumes while displaying our results on the web.  <p>We will meet once a week for 50 minutes for the rest of the academic year.
