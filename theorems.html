<MENU><li>"Compact groups of homeomorphisms on tree-like continua," Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, V267 (1981) pp. 609-619.</li>
<li><ul>Theorems in this paper include the following:"
<LI>If G is a finite group of homeomorpisms acting on a tree-like curve, then the fixed point set of each element of G is tree-like.</li>
<LI>If G is a finite group of homeomorphisms acting on a tree-like curve, then the fixed point set of G is tree-like.</li>
<LI>Suppose that M is tree-like, h:M->M is periodic and F is the fixed point set of h. If x is an element of M-F, then no continuum in M-F contains both x and h(x).</li>
<LI>Suppose that M is an irreducible tree-like curve and each indecomposable subcontinuum of M has void interior in M.  If h is a periodic homeomorphism of M, then hoh is
the identity.</li>
<LI>If G is a compact group of homeomorphisms acting on a tree-like curve, then the fixed point set of each element of G is tree-like.</li>
<LI>If G is a compact group of homeomorphisms acting on a tree-like curve, then the fixed point set of G is tree-like.</li>
<LI>If h is a pointwise periodic homeomorphism acting on a hereditarily indecomposable tree-like curve, then h has a fixed point.</li>

<Li>The following are equivalent:<ol><li>
there is a fixed integer, n<sub>0</sub> > 0
such that every map of X<sup>oo</sup> into X<sup>oo</sup>
has an n<sub>0</sub> shift point.
<li>
every point of X<sup>oo</sup> is an infinite shift point
for every map of X<sup>oo</sup> to X<sup>oo</sup>.
<li> X<sup>oo</sup> has the fixed point property.
</ol>
<LI>Every point of the Hilbert Cube is an infinite shift point.

<menu><li>"The combinatorics of all regular flexagons," European Journal of Combinatorics, (2010), V31 Number 1, pp 72-80.</li>

<li>An algorithm to count the number of initial faces for <a href="flex/index.html">flexagons</a> of order 3n for all n.
Our claim that we also counted the number of mathematical faces is only true for n < 4 as pointed out by Ralph Jones. For n > 3, It is unknown if every face can be translated
by exactly one triangle, producing another mathematical face.</li>
