<p>Thursday 9/15<br>First day to walk 330 feet  without a break.
Working hard at OT to improve her buttoning skills. Social worker told Alison this morning that she will
have therapy all morning tomorrow. Then I will transport her to Metter, GA and she will check into Candler County Hospital
swing unit. Medicare pays 100% for 20 days. Hopefully, we will get home before that.
She never had a low blood pressure problem today and the doctors think they have her meds so that it doesn't reoccur..

<P>Wednesday 9/14<br>
Today is a repeat of yesterday. Low blood pressure, dizzyness, but allowed to continue.
Very strong and doing great.</font>
<p>Tuesday 9/13 <br>Low blood pressure made her dizzy while she was at therapy. She was happy to be able to complete it.
She got out of bed on her own and wheeled herself to therapy. Rumor has it that Dr Jain and Dr Kapor from Augusta
will be consulted about the dizzyness. The new move out date is Friday, 9/16.

Monday 9/12<br>
Repeat of the early low blood pressure so she did not go to PT nor OT.  I stopped at Candler  County Hospital in Metter
to check it out. When I arrived at  St. Joesph's, I told Social Services that my  choices were Candler County, Screven County, and
go home. Before I left tonight, Candler called to say that they would take her. Because of the dizzyness, we will get more information tomorrow.
She could be dismissed or not.

<p>Sunday 9/11<br>Day went as planned. One more dizzy spell and a great dinner. ADL at 8 in the morning. I hope to be there by 11:30.



<p>Saturday 9/10<br>


She has had 3 very good days. They have just been plain fun for both of us. She does have one new problem where she
gets dizzy after standing up. The hospital doctor talked to her and he thinks that it might be an interaction
between two of her medicines. She only takes 20, but he has changed one and we will see if it helps. I	do not know how this affects
her dismissal date from here.
Her appetite is very good
and has ordered me to bring food from our favorite restaurant, Pearl's Seafood Grill. Her hair dresser sisters drove over from Metter and
spent a couple of hours on her hair and nails. She is beautiful.




<p>
Friday 9/9<br>7:00 am<br>
Yesterday we had a great day all day. Alison was so much fun, working and helping to plan every thing.
Based upon the board, which said OT at 8:00 Fri, I was up at 5 this morning
in order to drive here, dress her, and feed her. After I get here
they tell me that a bath is scheduled as a part of OT. So much for the board. At least we had a great breakfast.
 When I asked, they took me to the board where it was clearly marked, ADL at 8.

 The good and the bad news is that we move out
of St. Joesph's Tuesday. So we are looking at transition facilities that provide PT and OT. We know of one in Screven and
one
in Metter. They gave us a list of 20 in Savannah. I went and saw Pruitt on White Bluff and Alison called another. Our first
wish is that she feels like coming home and plan B  is to find something close to Bulloch County. Help if you know of something.
<p>
Thursday 9/8<br>8:30 am<br>

Saw the surgeon last night. He was just as upbeat as his PA. I said "Why does she still hurt?"
and he answered "This is a very rough surgery" . When asked about going home, he insisted that she stay here
for some time. I drove in this morning and forgot how hard it is to live in
a big city. I could not believe how happy she was as I
entered her room. I helped her sit up, get dressed, and fed her. She told me that the Social Team had been in to talk about
what is next. I should wait until I talk to them, but she thinks we will move out next Tuesday.
Not sure if it means another facility or home. Today I would vote for home. PT for an hour and then OT for an hour and then lunch. Maybe we can get to the Social Team
this afternoon.

Wednesday 9/7<BR>8:00 am<BR>
Alison has worn a neck brace continuously since her first surgery. I dropped some turnip greens
into it duringing dinner last night. Thus we washed it and left it off to dry. When I left
 for the night,
 I reminded the nurses to put it on. At 8 this morning she refused to get ready until the brace was reinstated.

We had a great morning and she headed for PT and OT at 9:00. Total time working
is the same as yesterday, but won't
finish until 4:30 today.
<BR>4:00 pm <br>We walked 450 feet today. Her doctor's PA came in after lunch and removed 30 +/- 5 stitches. The PA
consoled us and assured us that the surgery went very well. We took a picture of her stitches yesterday. Will send upon request.


<p>Tuesday 9/6<br>9:00 am<BR>Tuesday is here. This is the board I read last Friday.  She is back to her
usual fun loving self. She ate all of her breakfast mostly by her self. They
took her to PT first. PT wears her out and she doesn't enjoy the OT as much. She doesn't know that she will
also end the day
with PT at 2:30 this afternoon. The range [8:30, 3:00] is the largest so far. She walked 200 feet. <br>
1:00 pm<BR>One O'clock came so she wheeled herself all the way to OT. They gave her a rotating pedal to be used with her hands.
The clock was set for 4 minutes.
<p>Labor Day 9/5<br>
An emotional day. She was not able to handle the breakfast tools. The staff thought she should feed her self. On to PT
where she fell, similar to yesterday. No one hurt,  but leg buckled today and yesterday.
I fed her lunch and dinner. It is a fine line between feeding her every thing and
working with her so she can try to do it herself. I will be here at 8:00 tomorrow to
push her on.

<p>Sunday 9/4<br>7:00 pm<br>
David and Emily were here for the night and spent a lot of time with her. Thanks. No PT today, but back at it tomorrow.
I don't know about lunch, but dinner tonight
was the first time that she has joined the clean plate club this last month. I was pleased. In addition,
she ate 50% of the food with no assistance.
She got to the side of the bed and Emily and David helped her start a walk. After 40 feet she fell back into the trailing
wheelchair.
Then they put her into a wheelchair and
headed for the out of doors. All in all, a very  nice day. Tomorrow, PT starts again and I'll be back by lunch.

<p>9/3/2016<br>11:15 <BR>No one told me that there were different boards for weekends and holidays. so here I am reading next
Tuesday's board and using that information, I came in early to have her ready for PT by 8:30 am. I got her out of bed to
brush her teeth and comb her hair <<Picture doesn't show it>>, but

when breakfast had not arrived by 8:15 I was concerned.   OT showed up at 8:45 and explained the weekend routine. I
was reading next Tuesday's schedule. Just like people that change webpages, they added
small paper copies of the Memorial Day weekend schedule to the real board. In the picture above, a KY hoop shows up
and all of the clothes pins had been added by our star pupil. The green ones were especially tough and she gave a raspberry
to the gator helper with each successful green clip that was added. The walking distance for today was 75 feet. Emily and her husband
David will replace me at 3:30 and I will spend the nightin the Boro.

1:30<br>At 11:00, she was busy with PT. The above picture shows her walking 50 feet with a former Florida gator.
The gator made one crack about the red and black before I told her about the loyalties of her patient.
 There is a second
worker  coming from behind with a wheel chair if she falls. After the morning PT, I fed her lunch where
she ate 50% including all of her fried fish. At 1:00, she returned to PT.
When I went back they had her leg in a stretchy and
were making her push and pull it to strengthen her muscels.Her pain level is a 7,
but she was very comfortable while talking to Andrew on the phone. She likes to joke with the staff.

<P>9/1/2016<BR>1:30<BR>PT wore her out. The nurse was feeding her lunch when I walked in with her clothes for the week.
They said she needed 50% assistance when standing and a little help walking. After
15 minutes<p>
she insisted on lying down to rest. We made it to the bed in time for PT. I was able
to talk them into bed games. Pain level was an 8 and they gave her a pill. I just returned from lunch and Alison is sound
to sleep and comfortable. I assume drugs are doing their job.I expect her to snore away the afternoon.
<BR>8:30 <BR>Except for eating, she has slept continuously.She ate very well and talked to Emily
on the phone while. Alison was eating and Emily was stuck
  in Atlanta traffic. I will stay off the roads after 10 PM tonight  because of the storm and will bed down here in Savannah.
Really hard to believe Southern has cancelled classes tomorrow.I expect Alison to sleep until 5:00 am.

<p>Wednesday 8/31/2016<br>
6:50 am <br>
The average time in Rehab is 8.5 days. She slept through the night and met her new female doctor who says
she works for the therapists. The therapists will work Alison 3 - 6 hours aday, 5 days a week. The days will probably include
some week end days and holidays.
<p>8:05 am <br>Except for a meal and meeting her doctor, she has slept for the last 14 hours. She was very lucid during the
hour and a half that she was awake.
<p>Noon<br>I cam back from the break room and couldn't find her.
I was directed to a huge bd that is suppose to tell me where she is. The red rectangle indicates she is in PT
while Blue is OT.
I watched as some
progress is being made. She ate half of every thing on her plate and enjoyed it all. The bd says she was done for the day,
but they came back at 1 and took her again.  The bd has been updated. It is like a changing web site. They came at 1:30
and brought her back. When asked about the bd, they said that it will be 90% right for tomorrow by 4:30 today.
Very tired and is sleeping, but already the best day
since we arrived.

<p>Tuesday 8/30/2016  <BR>12:20 pm<br>


We expect Alison to move to rehab on the fourth floor of St. Joesph's Hospital.  She and Andrew are asleep in room 623 with
her hot food getting cold as usual. Last night was the first night I
thought I could sleep in Statesboro. Her pain was bad in the middle of the night, but Andrew talked her through it,
like Emily, Bob, and I have done. <p> 1:00 pm <br>We ordered French Toast for breakfast.

The
 best news of the day is that a pain management person from Optim just left. He is going to be responsible for her pain
and he will see it through to the end of this stay
or longer.
Up until now, she has been with a new person every day and some did not understand how much medicine she had been on.

<p >8:00 pm<br>The usual high pain hit at 3:30 and we moved to 435 in Rehab at 4:30. Pills knocked her out.
She is sleeping fine. Rehab tomorrow.<p>10:30 pm<BR>She received a gorgeous salad at 5:30 but she is just now
eating it. We threw the turkey away,
ate half of the remainder and half an apple. She is back asleep. Pain is a 4, a number I had not heard for 2 weeks.

<p>Previously<br>She was admitted to East Georgia Regional Hospital on Monday, 8/15/2016. where she was treated for low blood sugar,
low body temperature, and a UTI. She was released on that Thursday and saw her spine surgeon, Dr. McCormack, the next day.
He ordered her to St. Joesph's in Savannah that same day. There, she had surgery on Sunday morning,
inserting rods and screws from c3 to t1.
C3 to c5 needed shoring up so she had surgery on Thursday, 8/25/2016. They inserted plates and screws,
 entering from the throat. She was in NICU until returning to the 6th floor on Sunday.
