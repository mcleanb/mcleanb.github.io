1:30<br>At 11:00, she was busy with PT. The above picture shows her walking more than 40 feet. I fed her lunch where 
she ate 50% including all of her fried fish. We are back with the Florida gator that has her this hour for PT.

<P>9/1/2016<BR>1:30<BR>PT wore her out. The nurse was feeding her lunch when I walked in with her clothes for the week. 
They said she needed 50% assistance when standing and a little walking.
15 minutes before the one O'clock PT, she insisted on lying down to rest. We made it to the bed in time for PT. I was able
to talk them into bed games. Pain level was an 8 and they gave her a pill. I just returned from lunch and Alison is sound 
to sleep and comfortable. I assume drugs are doing their job.I expect her to snore away the afternoon. Check back
after 6:30. <BR>8:30 <BR>Except for eating, she has slept continuously.She ate very well and talked to Emily  
on the phone while she ate and Emily was stuck
  in Atlanta traffic. I will stay off the roads after 10 PM tonight and will bed down here in Savannah.
Really hard to believe Southern has cancelled classes tomorrow.I expect Alison to sleep until 5:00 am.

<p>Wednesday 8/31/2016<br>
6:50 am <br> 
The average time in Rehab is 8.5 days. She slept through the night and met her new female doctor who says 
she works for the therapists. The therapists will work Alison 3 - 6 hours aday, 5 days a week. The days will probably include 
some week end days and holidays.
<p>8:05 am <br>Except for a meal and meeting her doctor, she has slept for the last 14 hours. She was very lucid during the 
hour and a half that she was awake.
<p>Noon<br>I cam back from the break room and couldn't find her. 
I was directed to a huge bd that is suppose to tell me where she is. The red rectangle indicates she is in PT
while Blue is OT. 
I watched as some 
progress is being made. She ate half of every thing on her plate and enjoyed it all. The bd says she was done for the day, 
but they came back at 1 and took her again.  The bd has been updated. It is like a changing web site. They came at 1:30 
and brought her back. When asked about the bd, they said that it will be 90% right for tomorrow by 4:30 today. 
Very tired and is sleeping, but already the best day
since we arrived.

<p>Tuesday 8/30/2016  <BR>12:20 pm<br>


We expect Alison to move to rehab on the fourth floor of St. Joesph's Hospital.  She and Andrew are asleep in room 623 with 
her hot food getting cold as usual. Last night was the first night I
thought I could sleep in Statesboro. Her pain was bad in the middle of the night, but Andrew talked her through it, 
like Emily, Bob, and I have done. <p> 1:00 pm <br>We ordered French Toast for breakfast.

The 
 best news of the day is that a pain management person from Optim just left. He is going to be responsible for her pain 
and he will see it through to the end of this stay
or longer.  
Up until now, she has been with a new person every day and some did not understand how much medicine she had been on.

<p >8:00 pm<br>The usual high pain hit at 3:30 and we moved to 435 in Rehab at 4:30. Pills knocked her out. 
She is sleeping fine. Rehab tomorrow.<p>10:30 pm<BR>She received a gorgeous salad at 5:30 but she is just now
eating it. We threw the turkey away, 
ate half of the remainder and half an apple. She is back asleep. Pain is a 4, a number I had not heard for 2 weeks.

<p>Previously<br>She was admitted to East Georgia Regional Hospital on Monday, 8/15/2016. where she was treated for low blood sugar,
low body temperature, and a UTI. She was released on that Thursday and saw her spine surgeon, Dr. McCormack, the next day.
He ordered her to St. Joesph's in Savannah that same day. There, she had surgery on Sunday morning, 
inserting rods and screws from c3 to t1.
C3 to c5 needed shoring up so she had surgery on Thursday, 8/25/2016. They inserted plates and screws,
 entering from the throat. She was in NICU until returning to the 6th floor on Sunday.
