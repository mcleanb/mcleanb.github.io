Programs/Labs
		
       Pograms/Labs must be hand delivered to the instructor before 4:00pm on 
the due date.  If the instructor is not available you should hand deliver 
the program/lab to one of the personnel in the Math/Computer Science Office 
(room 208) and instruct that person to place the materials in the instructor's 
box.  The instructor is not responsible for any lost material (hand in your
work to a human being)!!!!

Include the following when turning in a Program:

1. A folder containing all of the below contents.  Your name would be on 
<strong>the outside upper right  hand,</strong> corner of this folder.

2. The listing of your program on fan-fold computer paper.  The paper should 
NOT be torn apart.

3. Your program disk that contains a working copy of the source code.  Your 
name should be on the disk.

4. The grade sheet for this program assignment.  This sheet should be readily 
visible in the folder.


Include the following when turning in a Lab:

1. A folder containing all of the below contents.  Your name should be on the 
outside upper right hand corner of this folder.

2. All program listings should be on fan-fold computer paper and NOT be torn 
apart.  If a program listing AND the output of that program are due,  then the 
output sheet should be stapled (or paper clipped) to the program listing.

3. The lab instructions will describe what is to be turned in for grading.  
Each and every sheet in the lab folder should be clearly labeled according to 
its part number (i.e.. Lab 1, part 3).

4. Any and all questions should be answered on notebook paper and labeled 
clearly.  This sheet should be readily visible in the folder.

                                  Notes:	-  

You should have different folders for your programs and labs.
		
You will most likely need 3 disks for this class.  Two for programs and one 
for lab.  Your lab disk is not to be turned in with the lab.	

Failure to label any documents will result in a 10 point penalty.
